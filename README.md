A program that runs chronopotentiometry experiments using a Keithley 2400 source meter.

This is a python program I have written to run chronopotentiometry experiments using a Keithley 2400 source meter. I can run both constant voltage and constant current sweeps and record the output along with a header specific to the membrane experiments I am doing.
