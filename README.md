A program that runs chronopotentiometry experiments using a Keithley 2400 source meter.

This is a python program I have written to run chronopotentiometry experiments using a Keithley 2400 source meter. I can run both constant voltage and constant current sweeps and record the output along with a header specific to the membrane experiments I am doing. 

Right now the program is very rough as it is cobbled together to do what I need, although I hope with time to get it to a real nice point. I am new to python programming (and programming in general) so it may take time and be poorly coded but as my skill increases hopefully this program will as well.
